ðŸ‘‹ Hi and welcome to my GitHub! 

My name is Russell and I am a Data Scientist/Engineer interested in Computer Vision, NLP and Machine Learning Applications for solving business problems.
- I currently work as a Software Engineer at Quandri where I build automation bots to simplify workflow processes
- Also work as an Instructor/mentor for Data Science courses at Lighthouse Labs.
- I am always interested in collaborating on any projects or interest pieces that you may require assistance on.

- ðŸ’¡ I enjoy working with NLP projects and have knowledge of Fine-tuning & applying BERT, ERNIE & GPT-2 models respectively for text generation and sentiment analysis
- Additionally, I have hands-on experience working with OCR and Facial Recognition/Video processing and really love that field of DS

I will continue periodically adding hobby repositories when I can, so in the meanwhile:
- Please reach out and connect with me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yearwoodrussell/) if you have any questions!
