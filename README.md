ðŸ‘‹ Hi and welcome to my GitHub! 

My name is Russell and I am a Data Scientist interested in Computer Vision, NLP and Machine Learning Applications for solving business problems.
- ðŸŒ± I currently work for a Tech Startup doing NLP-based work, as well as Instruct Data Science courses for Lighthouse Labs.
- I am always interested in collaborating on any projects or interest pieces that you may require assistance on.
- ðŸ’¡ I enjoy working with NLP projects and have knowledge of Fine-tuning & applying BERT, ERNIE & GPT-2/GPT-3 models respectively for text generation and sentiment analysis
- Additionally, I've gained professional, hands-on experience working with some very complex OCR and Facial Recognition/Video processing projects and really love that field of DS

I will continue periodically adding hobby repositories when I can, as most of my work is internal/under NDA. So in the meanwhile:
- Please reach out and connect with me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yearwoodrussell/) if you have any questions!
