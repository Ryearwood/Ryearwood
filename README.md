ðŸ‘‹ Hi and welcome to my GitHub! 

My name is Russell and I am a Data Scientist interested in Deep Learning and Machine Learning Applications.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working for a Tech Startup and Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any projects or interest pieces that you may require assistance on.
- ðŸ’¡ I enjoy working with NLP projects and have knowledge of Fine-tuning & applying BERT, ERNIE & GPT-2/GPT-3 models respectively for text generation and sentiment analysis

Over the next few months, I will be adding some hobby  repositories periodically so in the meanwhile:
- Please reach out and connect with me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yearwoodrussell/) if you have any questions!
