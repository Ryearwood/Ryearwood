ðŸ‘‹ Hi and welcome to my GitHub! 

My name is Russell and I am a recent Data Science Graduate(March, 2021) interested in Deep Learning, Big Data and Machine Learning Applications.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working for a Tech Startup and Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any projects or interest pieces that you may require assistance on.
- ðŸ’¡ I enjoy working with NLP projects and have knowledge of Fine-tuning & applying BERT and ERNIE models respectively for text and sentiment analysis

Over the next few months, I will be adding my personal repositories periodically so in the meanwhile:
- Please reach out and connect with me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yearwoodrussell/) if you have any ideas/projects that I may assist with!
