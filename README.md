ðŸ‘‹ Hi and welcome to my GitHub! 

My name is Russell and I am a recent Lighthouse Labs Data Science Graduate interested in Deep Learning, Big Data and Machine Learning Applications.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Reinforcement Learning Models and Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any projects or interest pieces that you may require assistance on.

Over the next few months, I will be adding my personal repositories periodically so in the meanwhile:
- Please reach out and connect with me via [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yearwoodrussell/) if you have any ideas/projects that I may assist with! 

<!---
Ryearwood/Ryearwood is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
